Create a python file called test.py and do the following;

Create the following variables 

x, y, z

assign the values 10, 5.4, 2 to the variables respectively.
then print out the solutions to the following problems;
x multiply y (*)
x divide z (/)
x subtract y (-)
y add z (+)

Use python to also print the datatypes of the variables of x, y, z

You are given the list 

data = [2,"Angel", 5, 6, 7.9, "Jabari",
"Jayden",2.3, True, "List", False "George", "Risper"]

Create a file named listass.py and perform the following operations on the list
1. Print the length of the list
2. Print all integers in the list
3. Print out all the items in the list


Create a file called whileass.py and solve the following problems

1. Write a program to print first 10 integers
    and their squares using while loop.

2. Write for loop statement to print the following series:
    10, 20, 30 … … 300

3. Write a while loop statement to print the following series
    105, 98, 91 ………7




Create a file called morefunctions.py and provide solutions
for the following problems

1. Write a program to print the sum of the first 10 Even numbers
2. Write a function to print table of a number entered as a parameter in function.
	e.g
	5  *  1  =  5
	5  *  2  =  10
	5  *  3  =  15
	5  *  4  =  20
	5  *  5  =  25
	5  *  6  =  30
	5  *  7  =  35
	5  *  8  =  40
	5  *  9  =  45
	5  *  10  =  50
3. Write a program to check whether a number is prime or not using while loop.
4. Write a function to print first 10 integers and their squares using while loop.
